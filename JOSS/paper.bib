	abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that gene products implicated in human cancers often cluster together in “hot spots” in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Additionally, small sub-networks within PPI networks that demonstrate synergistic differential expression with respect to tumorigenic phenotypes were recently shown to be more accurate classifiers of disease progression when compared to single targets identified by traditional approaches. However, many of these studies rely exclusively on mRNA expression data, a useful but limited measure of cellular activity. Proteomic profiling experiments provide information at the post-translational level, yet they generally screen only a limited fraction of the proteome. Here, we demonstrate that integration of these complementary data sources with a “proteomics-first” approach can enhance the discovery of candidate sub-networks in cancer that are well-suited for mechanistic validation in disease. We propose that small changes in the mRNA expression of multiple genes in the neighborhood of a protein-hub can be synergistically associated with significant changes in the activity of that protein and its network neighbors. Further, we hypothesize that proteomic targets with significant fold change between phenotype and control may be used to “seed” a search for small PPI sub-networks that are functionally associated with these targets. To test this hypothesis, we select proteomic targets having significant expression changes in human colorectal cancer (CRC) from two independent 2-D gel-based screens. Then, we use random walk based models of network crosstalk and develop novel reference models to identify sub-networks that are statistically significant in terms of their functional association with these proteomic targets. Subsequently, using an information-theoretic measure, we evaluate synergistic changes in the activity of identified sub-networks based on genome-wide screens of mRNA expression in CRC. Cross-classification experiments to predict disease class show excellent performance using only a few sub-networks, underwriting the strength of the proposed approach in discovering relevant and reproducible sub-networks.},

	abstract = {MicroRNA (miRNA)-based therapies are an emerging class of targeted therapeutics with many potential applications. Ewing Sarcoma patients could benefit dramatically from personalized miRNA therapy due to inter-patient heterogeneity and a lack of druggable (to this point) targets. However, because of the broad effects miRNAs may have on different cells and tissues, trials of miRNA therapies have struggled due to severe toxicity and unanticipated immune response. In order to overcome this hurdle, a network science-based approach is well-equipped to evaluate and identify miRNA candidates and combinations of candidates for the repression of key oncogenic targets while avoiding repression of essential housekeeping genes. We first characterized 6 Ewing sarcoma cell lines using mRNA sequencing. We then estimated a measure of tumor state, which we term network potential, based on both the mRNA gene expression and the underlying protein-protein interaction network in the tumor. Next, we ranked mRNA targets based on their contribution to network potential. We then identified miRNAs and combinations of miRNAs that preferentially act to repress mRNA targets with the greatest influence on network potential. Our analysis identified TRIM25, APP, ELAV1, RNF4, and HNRNPL as ideal mRNA targets for Ewing sarcoma therapy. Using predicted miRNA-mRNA target mappings, we identified miR-3613-3p, let-7a-3p, miR-300, miR-424-5p, and let-7b-3p as candidate optimal miRNAs for preferential repression of these targets. Ultimately, our work, as exemplified in the case of Ewing sarcoma, describes a novel pipeline by which personalized miRNA cocktails can be designed to maximally perturb gene networks contributing to cancer progression.},

	abstract = {A standard paradigm in computational biology is to use interaction networks to analyze high-throughput biological data. Two common approaches for leveraging interaction networks are: (1) network ranking, where one ranks vertices in the network according to both vertex scores and network topology; (2) altered subnetwork identification, where one identifies one or more subnetworks in an interaction network using both vertex scores and network topology. The dominant approach in network ranking is network propagation which smooths vertex scores over the network using a random walk or diffusion process, thus utilizing the global structure of the network. For altered subnetwork identification, existing algorithms either restrict solutions to subnetworks in subnetwork families with simple topological constraints, such as connected subnetworks, or utilize ad hoc heuristics that lack a rigorous statistical foundation. In this work, we unify the network propagation and altered subnetwork approaches. We derive a subnetwork family which we call the propagation family that approximates the subnetworks ranked highly by network propagation. We introduce NetMix2, a principled algorithm for identifying altered subnetworks from a wide range of subnetwork families, including the propagation family, thus combining the advantages of the network propagation and altered subnetwork approaches. We show that NetMix2 outperforms network propagation on data simulated using the propagation family. Furthermore, NetMix2 outperforms other methods at recovering known disease genes in pan-cancer somatic mutation data and in genome-wide association data from multiple human diseases.

	abstract = {Abstract The tremendous success of graphical neural networks (GNNs) has already had a major impact on systems biology research. For example, GNNs are currently used for drug target recognition in protein-drug interaction networks as well as cancer gene discovery and more. Important aspects whose practical relevance is often underestimated are comprehensibility, interpretability, and explainability. In this work, we present a graph-based deep learning framework for disease subnetwork detection via explainable GNNs. In our framework, each patient is represented by the topology of a protein-protein network (PPI), and the nodes are enriched by molecular multimodal data, such as gene expression and DNA methylation. Therefore, our novel modification of the GNNexplainer for model-wide explanations can detect potential disease subnetworks, which is of high practical relevance. The proposed methods are implemented in the GNN-SubNet Python program, which we have made freely available on our GitHub for the international research community ( https://github.com/pievos101/GNN-SubNet ).},

Interpreting a PPI, however, it is a particularly challenging task because of network complexity. Several algorithms have been proposed for an automatic PPI interpretation, at first by solely considering the network topology, and later by integrating Gene Ontology (GO) terms as node similarity attributes. Here we present MTGO - Module detection via Topological information and GO knowledge, a novel functional module identification approach. MTGO let emerge the bimolecular machinery underpinning PPI networks by leveraging on both biological knowledge and topological properties. In particular, it directly exploits GO terms during the module assembling process, and labels each module with its best fit GO term, easing its functional interpretation. MTGO shows largely better results than other state of the art algorithms (including recent GO-based ones) when searching for small or sparse functional modules, while providing comparable or better results all other cases. MTGO correctly identifies molecular complexes and literature-consistent processes in an experimentally derived PPI network of Myocardial infarction.

	abstract = {The human papillomavirus (HPV) is present in a significant fraction of head-and-neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). However, a comprehensive understanding of disease progression profiles comparing HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC cases is still lacking. The main goal of this study was to identify distinct co-expression patterns between HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC and to provide insights into potential regulatory mechanisms/effects (such as methylation and mutation) within the analyzed networks. For conducting this, we selected 276 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database comprising data of gene expression, methylation profiles and mutational patterns, in addition to clinical information (HPV status and tumor staging). We further added external information such as the identification of transcription factors to the networks. Genes were selected as differentially expressed and differentially methylated based on HPV status, of which 12 genes were doubly selected, including SYCP2, GJB6, FLRT3, PITX2 and CCNA1 . Weight correlation network analysis was used to identify co-expression modules and a systematic approach was applied to refine them and identify key regulatory elements integrating results from the other omics. Three main modules were associated with distinct co-expression patterns in HPV+ versus HPV- HNSCC. The molecular signatures found were mainly related to cell fate specification, keratinocyte differentiation, focal adhesion and regulation of protein oligomerization. This study provides comprehensive insights into complex genetic and epigenetic particularities in the development and progression of HNSCC in patients according to HPV status, identifying unseen gene interactions, and may contribute to unveiling specific genes/pathways as novel therapeutic targets for HNSCC.},

This knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus, realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations. Thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. Genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. On the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on PPIs. Based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the PPI and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. In particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application.

	abstract = {Objective
Computational drug repositioning can lead to a considerable reduction in cost and time in any drug development process. Recent approaches have addressed the network-based nature of biological information for performing complex prioritization tasks. In this work, we propose a new methodology based on heterogeneous network prioritization that can aid researchers in the drug repositioning process.
Methods
We have developed DrugNet, a new methodology for drug–disease and disease-drug prioritization. Our approach is based on a network-based prioritization method called ProphNet which has recently been developed by the authors. ProphNet is able to integrate data from complex networks involving a wide range of types of elements and interactions. In this work, we built a network of interconnected drugs, proteins and diseases and applied DrugNet to different types of tests for drug repositioning.
Results
We tested the performance of our approach on different validation tests, including cross validation and tests based on real clinical trials. DrugNet achieved a mean AUC value of 0.9552±0.0015 in 5-fold cross validation tests, and a mean AUC value of 0.8364 for tests based on recent clinical trials (phases 0–4) not present in our data. These results suggest that DrugNet could be very useful for discovering new drug uses. We also studied specific cases of particular interest, proving the benefits of heterogeneous data integration in this problem.
Conclusions
Our methodology suggests that new drugs can be repositioned by generating ranked lists of drugs based on a given disease query or vice versa. Our study shows that the simultaneous integration of information about diseases, drugs and targets can lead to a significant improvement in drug repositioning tasks. DrugNet is available as a web tool from http://genome2.ugr.es/drugnet/ (accessed 23.09.14). Matlab source code is also available on the website.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prioritization methods have become an useful tool for mining large amounts of data to suggest promising hypotheses in early research stages. Particularly, network-based prioritization tools use a network representation for the interactions between different biological entities to identify novel indirect relationships. However, current network-based prioritization tools are strongly tailored to specific domains of interest (e.g. gene-disease prioritization) and they do not allow to consider networks with more than two types of entities (e.g. genes and diseases). Therefore, the direct application of these methods to accomplish new prioritization tasks is limited.
RESULTS: This work presents ProphNet, a generic network-based prioritization tool that allows to integrate an arbitrary number of interrelated biological entities to accomplish any prioritization task. We tested the performance of ProphNet in comparison with leading network-based prioritization methods, namely rcNet and DomainRBF, for gene-disease and domain-disease prioritization, respectively. The results obtained by ProphNet show a significant improvement in terms of sensitivity and specificity for both tasks. We also applied ProphNet to disease-gene prioritization on Alzheimer, Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and Breast Cancer to validate the results and identify putative candidate genes involved in these diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: ProphNet works on top of any heterogeneous network by integrating information of different types of biological entities to rank entities of a specific type according to their degree of relationship with a query set of entities of another type. Our method works by propagating information across data networks and measuring the correlation between the propagated values for a query and a target sets of entities. ProphNet is available at: http://genome2.ugr.es/prophnet. A Matlab implementation of the algorithm is also available at the website.},

	abstract = {Many human genetic disorders and diseases are known to be related to each other through frequently observed co-occurrences. Studying the correlations among multiple diseases provides an important avenue to better understand the common genetic background of diseases and to help develop new drugs that can treat multiple diseases. Meanwhile, network science has seen increasing applications on modeling complex biological systems, and can be a powerful tool to elucidate the correlations of multiple human diseases. In this article, known disease-gene associations were represented using a weighted bipartite network. We extracted a weighted human diseases network from such a bipartite network to show the correlations of diseases. Subsequently, we proposed a new centrality measurement for the weighted human disease network (WHDN) in order to quantify the importance of diseases. Using our centrality measurement to quantify the importance of vertices in WHDN, we were able to find a set of most central diseases. By investigating the 30 top diseases and their most correlated neighbors in the network, we identified disease linkages including known disease pairs and novel findings. Our research helps better understand the common genetic origin of human diseases and suggests top diseases that likely induce other related diseases.},

	doi = {10.1093/gigascience/gix111},
	abstract = {Background: Networks have been proven effective representations for the analysis of biological data. As such, there exist multiple methods to extract knowledge from biological networks. However, these approaches usually limit their scope to a single biological entity type of interest or they lack the flexibility to analyze user-defined data.
Results: We developed ProphTools, a flexible open-source command-line tool that performs prioritization on a heterogeneous network. ProphTools prioritization combines a Flow Propagation algorithm similar to a Random Walk with Restarts and a weighted propagation method. A flexible model for the representation of a heterogeneous network allows the user to define a prioritization problem involving an arbitrary number of entity types and their interconnections. Furthermore, ProphTools provides functionality to perform cross-validation tests, allowing users to select the best network configuration for a given problem. ProphTools core prioritization methodology has already been proven effective in gene-disease prioritization and drug repositioning. Here we make ProphTools available to the scientific community as flexible, open-source software and perform a new proof-of-concept case study on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to disease prioritization.
Conclusions: ProphTools is robust prioritization software that provides the flexibility not present in other state-of-the-art network analysis approaches, enabling researchers to perform prioritization tasks on any user-defined heterogeneous network. Furthermore, the application to lncRNA-disease prioritization shows that ProphTools can reach the performance levels of ad hoc prioritization tools without losing its generality.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-018-2216-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prioritizing genes according to their associations with a cancer allows researchers to explore genes in more informed ways. By far, Gene-centric or network-centric gene prioritization methods are predominated. Genes and their protein products carry out cellular processes in the context of functional modules. Dysfunctional gene modules have been previously reported to have associations with cancer. However, gene module information has seldom been considered in cancer-related gene prioritization.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel method, MGOGP (Module and Gene Ontology-based Gene Prioritization), for cancer-related gene prioritization. Different from other methods, MGOGP ranks genes considering information of both individual genes and their affiliated modules, and utilize Gene Ontology (GO) based fuzzy measure value as well as known cancer-related genes as heuristics. The performance of the proposed method is comprehensively validated by using both breast cancer and prostate cancer datasets, and by comparison with other methods. Results show that MGOGP outperforms other methods, and successfully prioritizes more genes with literature confirmed evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: This work will aid researchers in the understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases, and improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of therapy.},

	abstract = {How closely related are two nodes in a graph? How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the "connection subgraphs", personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) block- wise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman- Morrison lemma for matrix inversion. Experimental results on the Corel image and the DBLP dabasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant savings over the straightforward implementations: they can save several orders of magnitude in pre-computation and storage cost, and they achieve up to 150x speed up with 90\%+ quality preservation.},

	abstract = {Bioinformatics research frequently involves handling gene-centric data such as exons, transcripts, proteins and their positions relative to a reference coordinate system. The ensembldb Bioconductor package retrieves and stores Ensembl-based genetic annotations and positional information, and furthermore offers identifier conversion and coordinates mappings for gene-associated data. In support of reproducible research, data are tied to Ensembl releases and are kept separately from the software. Premade data packages are available for a variety of genomes and Ensembl releases. Three examples demonstrate typical use cases of this software.ensembldb is part of Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/ensembldb).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Implementation of Kernelized score functions and other semi-supervised learning algorithms for node label ranking to analyze biomolecular networks. RANKS can be easily applied to a large set of different relevant problems in computational biology, ranging from automatic protein function prediction, to gene disease prioritization and drug repositioning, and more in general to any bioinformatics problem that can be formalized as a node label ranking problem in a graph. The modular nature of the implementation allows to experiment with different score functions and kernels and to easily compare the results with baseline network-based methods such as label propagation and random walk algorithms, as well as to enlarge the algorithmic scheme by adding novel user-defined score functions and kernels.},
