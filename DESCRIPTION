Description: Provides a general framework for the identification of nodes that 
             are functionally related to a set of seeds in graph structured data. 
             In addition to being optimized for use with generic graphs, 
             We also provides support to analyze protein-protein 
             interactions networks from online repositories. Our methods are similar to 
             those described in Nibbe et.al (2010). <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000639>.
