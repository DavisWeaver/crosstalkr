Description: Provides a general framework for the identification of nodes that are functionally related to a set of seeds in graph structured data. In addition to being optimized for use with generic graphs, we also provides support to analyze protein-protein interactions networks from online repositories. For more details on core method, refer to Nibbe et al. (2010) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000639>.
